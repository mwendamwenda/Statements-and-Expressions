// console.log('kenya ia canaan that God gave us');
true && false && !false //this is  a expression since in the end it will produce a boolean value(expression produce results)


// a statement in java script is a bigger piece of code that is excuted and does not produce results by itself

if(23 > 10){
    const str ='23 is greater than 10'
    console.log(str);
}

const me = 'mwenda';
console.log(`i am ${2022 - 1992} years old ${me}`)//this makes sense that when making literals javascript needs expressions only and not statements
